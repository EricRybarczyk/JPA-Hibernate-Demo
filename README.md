# JPA Hibernate Demo
UNDER DEVELOPMENT, NOT COMPLETE (September 2020)

This is a Spring Boot demo app which was developed as a tool for learning JPA and Hibernate. Unit Tests with JUnit 5 provide verification of intended functionality. 

The purpose of this code was simply to learn and explore core features of JPA and Hibernate. It is not intended to be a reference architecture for data access code overall, nor does it provide a comprehensive API for a production-grade application.

This project was created while completing the [Master JPA and Hibernate with Spring Boot](https://www.udemy.com/course/hibernate-jpa-tutorial-for-beginners-in-100-steps) course by [in28Minutes](https://courses.in28minutes.com).
